Enyo FusionCharts
=================

# Enyo Control for FusionCharts

http://www.fusioncharts.com/ provides professional charting capabilities.

enyo.FusionCharts provides a wrapper to present, control, and receive events from these charts.

## FusionCharts compatibility
This control has been designed against FusionCharts XT v3.3.1 SR2

Currently the control only wraps the JavaScript version of FusionCharts. Support for the Flash version of FusionCharts should be a simple addition, but has not been implemented.

## Example
An example is provided in the Examples directory. Because the FusionCharts library and support files are required, the example is not fully functioning as is. To test you will need to clone the repository and drop FusionCharts into place.
